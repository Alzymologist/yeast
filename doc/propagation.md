# Propagation

version = 0.2.0

## Outline

This process is used for propagation of pure culture into large volume of cell suspension either to prepare product or for research/testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Starting colony
- Sterile transfer set
- Test tube with approx. 15 ml sterile wort
- Vessel with approx. 50 ml sterile wort
- Vessel with approx. 200 ml sterile wort
- Sterile pipette capable of measuring 13 ml and pipet driver
- Set of vessels with approx. 50 ml sterile wort each
- Equally numbered set of vessels with approx. 150 ml sterile wort each

## Procedure

1. Transfer starting colony into test tube.
2. Incubate test tube at set temperature until signs of intense fermentation in stationary phase ("high krausen") are observed.
3. Transfer to vessel with 50 ml wort; incubate until stationary phase.
4. Transfer to vessel with 200 ml wort; incubate until stationary phase.
5. Use pipette to transfer 13 ml of wort into vessels with 50 ml wort; incubate all until stationary phase.
6. (optional) use one of vials as starting vessels of step (5) to bootstrap next propagation sequence at early stationary phase stage.
7. Transfer each vessels into larger one; incubate until later stages of stationary phase to prepare for packaging.

# Propagation

version = 0.2.0

## Outline

This process is used for propagation of pure culture into large volume of cell suspension either to prepare product or for research/testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Starting colony
- Sterile transfer set
- Test tube with approx. 15 ml sterile wort
- Vial with approx. 40 ml sterile wort
- Vial with approx. 100 ml sterile wort
- Vial with approx. 250 ml sterile wort
- Sterile pipette capable of measuring 13 ml and pipet driver
- Set of vials with approx. 50 ml sterile wort each
- Equally numbered set of vials with approx. 150 ml sterile wort each

## Procedure

1. Transfer starting colony into test tube
2. Incubate test tube at set temperature until signs of intense fermentation in stationary phase ("high krausen") are observed
3. Transfer to vial with 40 ml wort; incubate until stationary phase
4. Transfer to vial with 100 ml wort; incubate until stationary phase
5. Transfer to vial with 100 ml wort; incubate until stationary phase
6. Use pipette to transfer 13 ml of wort into vials with 50 ml wort; incubate all until stationary phase
7. (optional) use one of vials as starting vial of step (6) to bootstrap next propagation sequence at early stationary phase stage
8. Transfer each vial into larger one; incubate until later stages of stationary phase to prepare for packaging

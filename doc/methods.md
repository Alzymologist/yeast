# Volume measurements

For convenience (and since it does not increase errors noticeably), we use mass measurements to determine volumes. Where relevant, mass units are listed.

## Analysis

Water density estimation: mean = 977 kg/m3; sd = 3 kg/m3

# Pitch volume measurement

## Overview

When pitching sample to larger one, it is more important to maintain sterility than to measure volume.

## Procedure

1. Mark sample level on the vial
2. Perform sterile transfer
3. Rinse the vial and reasonably dry it
4. Measure weight of vial
5. Fill vial with water till the mark from (1)
6. Measure weight of vial with water
7. Record mass of water; determine volume.

## Analysis

We've determined following sd values (estimated top):

test tube: 0.2 g
40ml propagation vial: 1 g

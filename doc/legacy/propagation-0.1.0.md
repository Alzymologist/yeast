# Propagation

version = 0.1.0

## Deprecation note

This scaling up protocol results in difficult to manage final volume of yeast and requires risky division step on packaging. The protocol is changed thus to focus on handling each package individually.

## Outline

This process is used for propagation of pure culture into large volume of cell suspension either to prepare product or for research/testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Starting colony
- Sterile transfer set
- Test tube with approx. 15 ml sterile wort
- Vial with approx. 40 ml sterile wort
- Vial with approx. 100 ml sterile wort
- Vial with approx. 250 ml sterile wort
- Vial with approx. 750 ml sterile wort

## Procedure

1. Transfer starting colony into test tube
2. Incubate test tube at set temperature until signs of intense fermentation in stationary phase ("high krausen") are observed
3. Transfer to next larger vial; repeat until required volume is inoculated
4. In final vial, wait for end of intense fermentation for biomass growth. Resulting product when resuspended would be approximately 4-5 times smaller than the last fermentation volume

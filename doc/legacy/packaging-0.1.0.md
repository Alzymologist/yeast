# Yeast packaging for sale

version = "0.1.0"

## Overview

This protocol outlines packaging of small yeast containers for sale

## Prerequisites

- Propagated yeast mass in a vessel
- Sterile containers
- Sterile transfer kit
- Sterile water, approximately 1/5 of yeast mass volume
- Filling funnel, sterilized
- Labels, bags, and other packaging components

## Procedure

1. Let yeast settle; if this is unreasonably slow, facilitate it by rapid cooling.
2. Pour out and discard as much liquid phase as possible
3. Add sterile water to vessel in small portions and re-suspend caked yeast into paste by gentle motion
4. Pour yeast suspension into sterile containers through the funnel to avoid splashing the orifice or outer surfaces; close containers
5. Gently cool containers to storage temperature.

## Notes

This version of protocol was used once; it was found to be unreasonably laboursome and risky.

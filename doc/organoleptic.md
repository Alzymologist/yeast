# Organoleptic analysis

version = "0.1.0"

## Overview

This document outlines operations involved in organoleptic testing

## Prerequisites

- Samples
- Aestetically pleasing containers allowing for flavor development
- Density measurement tool (optional)

## Procedure

1. Gently pour samples into separate containers, trying to avoid resuspending of yeast
2. Measure density of samples (only one could be used if convergence of density-dependant parameter was demonstrated otherwise)
3. Analyze samples smell; record observations
4. Analyze samples taste; record observations
5. Discard excesses; recycle yeast mass.
